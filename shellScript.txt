limit
================================================================================

csh:
limit                   # shows limit
unlimit                 # lift all limits, include fd

bourne:
ulimit -a       # show all limit
ulimit -s unlimited     # no bound for stack size lilmit
ulimit -n 1024          # number of open file descriptor, sh need this separate
 from -s unlimited
                        # somehow can't seems to go above 1024 on sh
        -H              # hard limit
        -S              # soft limit (default set both)

open file descriptor limit need to be reset in /etc/system as
        set rlim_fd_max=4096
kernel default 8=1024,9+=64k, but different shell limit -n are soft limit, and
lock it to 1024 to 4096, which is probably still okay
/etc/system param change should not be needed in sol 9 and 10, few program can
use more than 64k.

mail.
use /usr/ucb/Mail, exist in linux and solaris

cat FILE | Mail -s "subject line" tho01@cs

(linux mail does not support -s subject option, while solaris will not use the
first line of the message that has 'Subject: bla' in it as the subject.)


wisdom from Mohit:
set absolute path at the beginning of the script.  
this way, no need to define commands with full path.
The only other issue is, same command, such as awk, maybe in multiple places,
which is not really same (linux awk is solaris nawk).  Path sequence need to
be assigned carefully for such commands.  In a very heterogeneous platform,
maybe hard and hard path prefered...

LD_PRELOAD_OPTS=...
This environemnt will allow specific library to be "preloaded", before LD_LIBRARY_PATH modules get loaded.  This way, program that has specific requirements for libs but may otherwise conflict with studd in LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be preferentially loaded first, thus used first and resolve incomptabilities issues.

eg:
make LD_PRELOAD_OPTS=/apps/lib 


other important env var (at least for RHEL):
PATH   MANPATH   LD_LIBRARY_PATH   LD_RUN_PATH   INCLUDE_PATH   C_INCLUDE_PATH

emulating main fn with argument passing:

have fn called
main() 
{ ... }

then at end of file, call it as 
main $*

$* = all arguments

inside the function, 
$1 = first argument
use x=$1  if want to assigne the argument to a variable, don't use set x=$1


The actual calling of the fn does not need () before args.
fn really become mini shell scripts w/in the script.
(fn implementation is really like a kludgy after-thought)

declare -F	# list all defined fn by name
declare 	# complete details of all defined functions in current shell

.bashrc vs .bash_profile  vs .profile

** just put everything in .bashrc **

http://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile 
has a long post about it.
.bash_profile/.profile should have been more extensive than .bashrc
just so that old slow modem don't have to source login shell stuff more than once.
nowadays, have .bash_profile source .bashrc is perfectly fine, and is done by most OS by default now. 


Some gory details:

- bash will not source .profile if .bashrc exist
- .bashrc isn't sourced when it is executed as the login shell (eg ssh, su -)
    - the GUI is the interactive login shell, each terminal is a non-login interactive shell, thus xterm source .bashrc only.
- .bashrc IS sourced as new screen session.
- .profile had some sort of conflict for module and bash.  time to forget /bin/sh :)

heredocs for sh:

cat > /tmp/heredoc.txt << END_HEREDOC
some long text
that span
many lines
END_HEREDOC


it can be hacked to emulate goto which doesn't exist in bash:
cat >/dev/null << LABEL
# sh code 
# that will 
# be skipped
LABEL

# code that will be exeucted




bash support multiline echo, so heredocs are less critical:
echo "
some long text
that span
many lines
" > /tmp/heredoc.txt


for multilines comment, can use a variation of the fork bomb as:

: '
blah blah blah
foo
bar
baz

#### argggg... no fn in t/csh :(  http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/CshTop10.txt
#### also google for "csh considered harmful"
#### why is cmaq still stuck in csh ??!!

csh has a GOTO command (bash don't, but can use heredocs to emulate the fn):

goto label
echo this won't execute

label:
echo this will execute


so, instead of fn, can use goto 
wonderful!


csh may not source .login just like bash may not source .profile ?
docker exec tcsh, does NOT source /etc/csh.login
but DOES source /etc/csh.cshrc
so put things in .cshrc  (like putting things in .bashrc).  eff-it :-/


** CSH Anoyance **

csh craps:

PATH is treated special in csh
it seems csh keep a sync of path and PATH as space and colon delimited list
only PATH has such special treatment, LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not.
##** $path is a space delimited list
##** $PATH is a colon delimited list
##** setenv expects a colon delimited list
##** set    expects a space delimited list


set path = ( ${path:q} /opt/openmpi/2.1.6/bin ) 
set path = ( $path /bin /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /usr/bin/X11 ~/bin /sbin /usr/sbin . )
##***  don't use $PATH above, it must be lower case $path in the parenthesis.  
##***  or else it will consider the colon delimited list as a unit and path won't work,
##***  even when displayed correctly!!  another reason why csh is bad!! =)

setenv PATH            "${PATH}:${AMGEN_HOME}/bin"
### above would works, ${PATH} can be used like that.  
### CSH treats : in variable name as manipulation token,
### braces {} will properly define where variable name eval ends.
### ${var:q}  will apply :q var evaluation to $var
### but ${var}:bla , : is outside variable name eval and not treated special by csh...

### csh variable modifiler , only 1 can be used, cannot be combined
#   :q  -- quote wordlist, keeping items separate; don't expand special metacharater (ie, keep things verbatim).  it does NOTHING on regard whether var exist or not
#   :x  -- quote a pattern, expand to wordlist
#   :e  -- get var extension.  these are like basename command?  eg set TEST=/foo/test.txt ; echo $TEST:e get txt
#   :t  -- get var's tail
#   :h  -- get header.  set TEST=/foo/bar/test.txt ; echo $TEST:h get /foo/bar
#   :ge -- get all extensions (for when there are multiple files?  space delimited?)

### tcsh add :l and :u to lowercase and uppercase the FIRST letter of the var
### http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Csh.html#uh-92
### https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_72/osmanagement/c_var_file_sub.html
### https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/unix/unixnut/ch05_03.htm


##** check path using env | grep -i path
##**  and NOT echo $PATH as csh treat such evaluation specially and 
##**  it will produce confusing results! 

###  *** CONCLUSION: Best use space and the lower case version!!  it is the most reliable way.
###  set path ( $path /more/path )
###  cuz csh will print $path without : in them and have properly "tokenized" the entries

### /etc/csh.login do this to update path (in a loop actually)
### set path = ( ${path:q} /opt/openmpi/2.1.6/bin ) 
### csh environment var qualifier :q may skip error when path was not declared or empty ??   NOPE, :q is for quote list

### LD_LIBRARY_PATH seems to be okay with the setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
### and colon separated list...

### csh need seed the variables before use.  very tedious!
### maybe ${VAR:q} can be appended without causing error when it was never declared before?

    if(! ${?PATH}) then
        set path = ( /bin ) # ie seed PATH since it was never defined
    endif
    if(! ${?LD_LIBRARY_PATH}) then
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/lib" # ie seed PATH since it was never defined
    endif



setenv  DISPLAY hostname:1
unsetenv DISPLAY		# undo setenv
set ...
unset ...			# undo set


CSH variable evaluation.
If a variable is not defined, trying to access it will give an error.
I guess it is like C programming language after all.
sh will just print blank, which I think is easier to deal with in shell script.

But anyway, in CSH, to guard against such error, need to test the variable 
being defined before using it.  eg

if ($?TRACE_LOG) then
        setenv TRACE_LOG "$TRACE_LOG openeye_processed"
else
        setenv TRACE_LOG "openeye_processed"
endif


if ($?MANPATH) then
        setenv MANPATH "${MANPATH}:/usr/share/man:/usr/man:/usr/local/man"
else
        setenv MANPATH "/usr/share/man:/usr/man:/usr/local/man"
endif

These kind of check should be done for things like LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.
There is probably an easier way, but :q doesn't really help.  
:q is used in csh.login likely to keep strange metacharacter from being interpreted.



csh if statement, string comparison

set machine = `hostname`
if !( ( ${machine} == "firth" ) || ( ${machine} == "firth.amgen.com" ) ) then
        echo "no Firth here... do work"
else
        echo "it is Firth here"
endif
