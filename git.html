<H1>GIT - Source Control</H1>
<A NAME="git"></A>

git is a very different beast than the other traditional source control system.  
Instead of having a "code centric" view to create trees and branches, git is more of a "developer centric" paradigm.  As such, many actions don't have the same parallel as say SVN, even though some commands seems similar on the surface.
<BR>
<BR>
git works as a two stage commit.  
commands to manipulate the local git database which is the central view of the scm.
Additionally, git can sync to a remote server (think github), and this is the repo server where many collaborators "check in" their codes for sharing.

<PRE>
git clone			# create a local copy of a source code tree
git commit -a 			# most basic workflow after edit, most like svn, commit all changes


git commit file1 file2		# check into local copy (but other don't see this change yet)
git commit file1 -m "comment"	# provide check in comment on cli rather than launch editor

git add file			# kinda feel like "add new file to be tracked"
				# but really is adding changes into the git db
git add -p 			# patch-based add (allow committing chunk of code at a time rather than whole file)

git status			# show commit staatus within the local copy of repo only.  
				# if the clone had been some time and master had seen other commits, 
				# it will NOT show up in the status command.  
				# only another git fetch would get these changes.

git status -uno 		# or --untracked-files=no  ##  dont show untracked files
git status -s | grep "^ M "  	# short mode, untracked files prefixed with ??



## think these are still acting on local copy.  in fact, it is likely that 
## git act on local copy, except for few commands to interact with master repo...

git log file1
git log 
git log --oneline         	# compact log, easier to read!

git log --oneline --graph --decorate	# can alias to "lol" for this oft use combo
git log -p 			# patch: show diff introduced by each change (instead of just commit msg for the log)

git log -p [-1] PATH/FILE	# list last -N COMMITED changes.  Current edit against git repo is NOT shown!
git diff ??			# find how PATH/FILE differ from current state with last commit in git
gitk FILE			# GUI tool to see commits/diff (but not branches?)

git log issue123 ^master	# branch diff, changes in branch issue123 but NOT in master

git branch --edit-description issue123	# modify a description for the named branch.  it brings up a text editor
git branch --list -v    	# list branches and descriptioins
				# actually, the info is last commit msg, branch desc so far only visible in the editor that comes up when using --edit-descriptiong.  thus, also  using git_branch.rst file... but 
git checkout -b issue123	# create a branch and switch to it at the same time (?)

<H5>git against "origin" </H5>

origin vs upstream?
<BR>

<TT>origin</TT> is typically the developer's central repo hosted on github, <BR>
or the hosting location of a fork of a project. <BR>
<BR> 
For team, non forked project, <TT>origin</TT> is the central repo residing on github.com or bitbucket.com
<BR>
<BR>
If fork is involved, see <TT>upstream</TT> below.
<BR>


<PRE>
git push			# get local copy pushed into "central", or source of clone.  other will get the changes now.
				# this uses the default, which really means git push origin master # for primary source, master branch.

git push origin master		# what "git push" is doing when other params are omitted
				# pushes my current "master" branch to central repo "origin" by uploading data (to github)

git pull			# sync local git db with the remote server db (eg github, aka central)
				# recommend to do this before pushing changes back to central.
				# pull (from central) daily or so when working on a branch to keep code merges manageable
				# and the pull does not "post" my local changes to central so no one knows about the local work 

git pull --rebase		# may want to do this before commit... so conflicts are local.
				# rebase has to do with where to insert changes into the original tree... 
				# rebase is typically the most desirable option
				# BUT...
				# in corp env, almost always better to use fetch and merge than pull --rebase
				# Hmm...
				# --rebase may work well between diff branches, where conflict files are few, changes between contributor are in "islands".
				# --rebase may NOT be so good w/in a branch of single contributor, since the edits on different machines likely rooted on same base and don't want to `rebase` that.


git fetch 			# get changes on master repo and sync them to local copy of the repo.  
				# conflict may arise from this.  
				# better resolve conflict here before committing/pushing.

git merge 			# merge branch


# it is prefered to resolve conflicts in local copy, 
# rather than push the changes out
# and have everyone look at changes at the global level, 
# which may cause lot of conflict in other's code.

# config git to use proxy
# note that shell env var http_proxy isn't heeded
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy01.eville.com:2011

git config --global --unset http.proxy


git config --global alias.proxy   "config --global http.proxy http://proxy01.eville.com:2011"
git config --global alias.noproxy "config --global --unset http.proxy"

git config --global alias.lol "log --oneline --graph --decorate"		# create alias "git lol"   # logd

</PRE>

<H5>git against "upstream"</H5>

<TT>upstream</TT> usually refer to the "grand daddy" repo of an open source project, where <TT>Pull Requests</TT> are submitted to add one's contribution to the open source project.  <BR>
Example workflow can be seen at 
<A HREF="http://singularity.lbl.gov/contributing-code">Singularity documentationcontribution</A> page.

<PRE>

# fork the project 
# git clone the fork above

git checkout master
git remote add "upstream" https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io


# made changes
git commit ...


# goal is to make any conflicting changes locally and 
# address them before pushing it upstream 
# where many other folks will see conflict and be affected by it
# below refer to push directly to master, though most project probably should commit to a dev branch of sort.

git pull upstream master		# resync upstream (grand daddy repo) to my master (what i forked)
git pull --rebase upstream master	# (same as?) `git pull --rebase`
# perform any necessary merges
git commit ...
git push origin master 			# (same as?) `git push`

# create Pull Request on github.com 
# forks are tracked by github.com, the PR will submit the changes to the grand daddy repo.

</PRE>

<H5>git between branches</H5>

<OL>	
	<LI>create a new branch, make changes, commit, close off branch once it is done</LI>
	<LI>Before branching, checkout into the branch where the merge will eventually be done against. eg <TT>git checkout dev; git branch tin-dev</TT></LI>
	<LI></LI>
	<LI></LI>
</OL>

<PRE>

git checkout tin
git pull          origin dev    # pull from origin, the dev branch, into the branch i am sitting in.
                                # do this before commit changes, help keep branch uptodate 
git pull --rebase origin dev    # --rebase seems to work out better when "parent" (dev) branch has lots of changes that I just want to keep.  

                                # git commit and push after pull should produce desirable result

--0--

git fetch				# update all branches ?

--0--

git checkout tin
						# merge had been really messy/fuzzy...
git merge develop		# pull changes from develop branch into the repo I am sitting in (tin)
git push origin   tin	# ie git push?  get my local changes into "origin" (bitbucket)


overall idea is to pull/fetch all changes into the branch I am doing edit.
resolve all conflicts (merge) locally.
then push the changes/commits into origin (bitbucket), then create PR.

If already created PR, 
still fetch all changes from "parent branch" locally.
resolve and commit , then PR will reflect the final change without conflic,
thereby allowing easy merge w/o conflict.



git branch        --delete BRANCH_NAME	# delete local branch, if all changes already pushed
git push   origin --delete BRANCH_NAME	# work on "origin", ie bitbucket, and remove the branch that is there.  ie, it include a push right away.

</PRE>


<H2>dealing with conflicts</H2>

<TT>git config merge.conflictstyle diff3 </TT>
will got a long way in automatically merging differences.
And those that actually have conflicting lines will be marked clearly in the file, search for 
<TT> <<<<  ||||  >>>> </TT>
<BR><BR>

There are also visual diff tools.
command line method using branch can also be used.
Refer to 
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git">post in stackoverflow</A>
for many other gory options.  <BR>

<H2>git in windows</H2>

Install wsl <BR>
<TT>sudo apt install git </TT><BR>
This is pretty usable. <BR>
can have the git run outside the lxfs subsystem, eg cd /mnt/c/... and git clone into a folder there.  it works too.
<BR>
Use terminal like Cmnder or <TT>apt get install lxterminal</TT> and use with like XcSvr.
<BR>




<H6>TL;DR</H6>

These notes are pre WSL, or if it was ever desired to use git but not WSL...<BR>
<BR>
There is a git client for windows, but the cli didn't suite my taste and need :( <BR>
in the git-bash terminal, git push will prompt for username in the cli, and a pop up GUI window for password. <BR>
<BR>

Cygwin and MobaXterm has provided a quite usable unix-like bash environment for windoze.  However, getting git to work has been very tricky :(
The following info from 
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14774159/git-warning-unable-to-access-p-gitconfig-invalid-argument#15498965">stack overflow</A> 
may help...
<BR>
unset HOMEPATH    <BR>
export HOME=/c    # in MINGW64 from PortableGit bash terminal  <BR>
<BR>

At the end, cygwin with the git that it ships with worked out okay for me, but it is not usable inside a mobaXterm tab. <BR>
export HOMEPATH=\      <BR>
export HOMEDRIVE=H:   <BR>
