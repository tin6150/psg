<A NAME="wsl"></A>
<H1>Windows Services for Linux aka Ubuntu on Win10</H1>

<PRE>

WSL is official in Fall Creator Edition of Windows 10 (2017?), avail in Windoze App Store.  
It is a Comptatibility Layer, no VM (hardware emulation), no recompilation.
It is like reverse of WINE.  
Linux ELF binary is run directly on windows.  WSL handles what would normally be linux kernel API calls.
It allows for userland process like bash.
Graphics mode stuff is not stable at this time (2017).
DBUS-X11, the interprocess messaging system in X11, is not avail in WSL at this time.

c:\windows\system32\bash.exe is a PE32+ executable.  source code compiled to work on windows.
/bin/bash is ELF LSB executable.

VM is Hardware emulation.
ParaVirtualization is Hardware Emulation, but has extra API calls that allows for Guest OS to interact with paravirtual
layer to run hard-to-execute code directly on host domain env.
Can be better in performance, less translation, but require guest to be ported to utilize the ParaVirtualization API cal
ls (drivers from the ParaVM).  eg: Xen hypervisor for Winwdows VM.  pv-ops.
ls can behave very differently between wsl/bash vs cygwin, especially for drive mapped by tools like Google Streamd Drive.


old beta:
Ubuntu root "visible" on windows under c:\users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\lxss\
But changing open files with windows tool would cause permanent data corruption, get file in locked state, and may require reinstall.
This maybe why in fall creator edition, the unix fs portion became an independent sub-system and not visible in windows.  (this folder path isn't there anymore, even after unhiding system files).

</PRE>

The bads:

<UL>
<LI>Terminal is based on the DOS prompt window, cut and paste is tedious :(.  ^C/^V may be helpful but not inside vim (2018.8)
<LI>No tab support in terminal.   
<LI>ConEMU provides multiple tabs.  But its far-manager heritage takes getting-used to.  Behavior/config maybe changing over time too?
<LI>No way to access linux subsystem files from Windows.  I am putting all files on the windows side in /mnt/c/Users.
</UL>

The meh:
<UL>
<LI> create sym links in WSL-bash ("ubuntu shell") (not cygwin or mobaXterm)
<LI> wsl bash create symlinks as unix symlinks.  cygwin can understand these.
<LI> cygwin create symlink as NFS link?  wsl-bash don't understand these, treat it as a file.
<LI>
</UL>

The decent:
<UL>
<LI>git works for files written to the windows side.  file downloaded with Unix LF format remains so.  vim will preserve this.  Did not invoke UNIX2DOS conversion.  Did not need git-for-windows :)
<EM>but git commit/push is having typechange problem, maybe permission...</EM>  This could be real problem :(
for now, need to use git from WSL/bash.
<!-- this was edited/saved into /mnt/c/Users/tin/tin-gh/psg/dos.html using vim and git in WSL.  git diff showed expected edits.  did not mangle any with CR.  -->
<LI> Ansible can be installed and it will work as ansible client/target.  Well, for now, I am using it with "localhost", so it is not ssh in from some central server.  But the Ubuntu is similar enough to say a VM running inside VirtualBox that largely the same playbook can be used in WSL instance.
</UL>

The good:
<UL>
<LI> MS seems to have the heart in a good place (did i really think this??!! :P).  
<LI>if the comptability layer keeps up, WSL would actually provide the closest Linux environment short of running a VM.   Better than Cygwin, probably better than macOS.  
</UL>

Ref:
<UL>
	<LI> <A HREF=https://cepa.io/2018/02/10/linuxizing-your-windows-pc-part1/#x-server">cepa article</A> has a very extensive review of WSL.
	<UL>
	<LI>apt install xfce4-terminal should hopefully be enough and light to add a real linux terminal.
	<LI>hyper is a native windows app, maybe look into.
	<LI>Cmder vs ConEmu
	</UL>
</UL>

<H2>unixy tool comparison in the wsl world</H2>

</PRE>


Notes
<OL>
<LI> cygwin without WSL may behave differently.  cygwin has its own set of tools downloadable from the setup.exe tool
<LI> ConEmu should be just using bash from wsl, thus should behave exactly the same as the ubuntu bash, except for the terminal emulation part.
<LI> apt-get install octave in wsl didn't work.  (there is a octave for windows, gui works, the .bat not yet).  On mac, "brew install octave" worked very well.  plots can launch GUI windows (cocoa? did not need to run X server).

<H5>Cygwin tweaks</H5>

Expect default home dir to be c:\cygwin\home\$USERNAME

<PRE>
export CygBaseDir="/cygdrive/c"
## $USER expect to be defined automagically, eg "t"
export CygUserBaseDir=${CygBaseDir}/Users/${USER}
ln -s ${CygBaseDir}/tin ./C_tin
ln -s ${CygUserBaseDir} ./WinHOME
ln -s ${CygUserBaseDir}/Desktop .
ln -s ${CygUserBaseDir}/Downloads .

# will run git clone in wsl , files in C:\tin, with sym links in there, no need for action here

ln -s /cygdrive/g  ./Gdrv
ln -s /cygdrive/g/My\ Drive/class/MLcoursera     .
ln -s /cygdrive/g/My\ Drive/class/MLcoursera_go1 .

</PRE>



<H5>MobaXterm tweaks</H5>
Expect home dir default to C:\temp or some transient location that is lost when program closes. <BR>
Manually change settings to put home dir to be same as cygwin, since it can access /cygdrive/c etc and thus share the sym links...
<BR>
Then don't need to crate any symlinks under Moba settings.  Only need to change its home dir.

<!-- C:\moba\$USERNAME    maybe best, it use /drives/C, symlink created not usable by WSL. -->

<!--
<PRE>
## $USERNAME expect to be defined automagically by mobaXterm, eg "t"
ln -s /cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/${USERNAME} ./cyg_T  

export BASEDIR="/drives/c"

export UserBaseDir=${BASEDIR}/Users/${USERNAME}
# ln can copy-n-paste from cygwin above
# or just use links in cyg_T 

</PRE>
-->



<H5>Ubuntu bash (WSL) tweaks</H5>

Expect default home dir to be some obscure/inaccessible place mounted as /home/$USERNAME

<PRE>
export WslBaseDir="/mnt/c"
export UserBaseDir=${WslBaseDir}/Users/t
ln -s ${WslBaseDir}/tin ./C_tin
ln -s ${UserBaseDir} 		./WinHome
ln -s ${UserBaseDir}/Desktop 	.
ln -s ${UserBaseDir}/Downloads 	.

# git repo is setup here, run psg/git.setup.gh.sh in wsl/ubuntu bash prompt
# stored in C:\tin
# with unix links here (cygwin generate ntfs-based links not usable here)
[[ -e tin-gh ]] || ln -s ${WslBaseDir}/tin/tin-gh ./tin-gh  # git.setup.gh.sh may have set this up already

</PRE>


<H5>ConEmu tweaks</H5>

<UL>
<LI> Expect default home dir to be /mnt/c/Users/$USER # ie Windows Home dir for active user
<LI> Import .xml config file with desired copy-n-paste, space, multiline dealing, etc (eg store in SkyDrive)
</UL>

<PRE>
ln -s /mnt/c/tin ./C_tin
</PRE>


<H2>"Single User" recovery mode for WSL</H2>

<PRE>
stop all user level instance of wsl (ie, stop all bash process).

Preview/Beta C:\> lxrun /setdefaultuser root
Fall Creator C:\> ubuntu.exe config --default-user root

bash		# this will get into elevated mode, but only after all user-level process have stoped
ubuntu run vi /etc/passwd
ubuntu run id

ubuntu /?

To return back to normal user mode:
ubuntu config --default-user jane

<A NAME=xserver></A>
<H2>Xserver</H2>
WSL doesn't provide an X-server.  So, like the old days, a windows based X server software is needed.  <BR>
Have not tried to run vncserver, but DBUS isn't avail, gnome-session has been reported not to work.  Maybe some old school Desktop Env that does not use DBUS may work.  Not sure if LXDE uses DBUS.  twm should not :)  <BR>

<A HREF="https://github.com/QMonkey/wsl-tutorial">QMonkey at github</A> has instructions to use xfce, even have way to fix DBUS error.  Will also need to fix fonts (including unicode and chinese), but implies it has gotten to work.

<A HREF="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2018/01/30/hands-on-with-wsl-graphical-apps.aspx">Fenton's article</A> reports x11-apps (xeyes), blockout2, works.  firefox works but no a/v.   vlc complains, but may have hacks.  
<UL>

<LI>vcXsrv    - small package.  Compiled by VC++.  Referred by QMonkey and other.
<LI>Xming     - Latest version is not entirely free anymore.  maybe a tad slower than vcXsrv.
<LI>Cygwin X  - may come with the full Cygwin env, which maybe big for system using WSL or Git-for-windows.
<LI>
<LI>Exceed (moneyware) 

</UL>

<H1>Unix-fying Windows/DOS, from Windows 7 days</H1>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</A> add a lot of standard unix tools, libraries, etc.  Includes a bash shell and X Window Manager for running X-based (GUI) apps.  It even has GNOME, KDE, keepassx (Qt), tetris!<BR>
<PRE>
  add this to PATH system variable  
  c:\cygwin\bin;c:\cygwin\sbin;c:\cygwin\usr\bin;c:\cygwin\usr\sbin;
  modern cygwin creates .bashrc in user's home dir and source that, so PATH can be setup there.

  A somewhat yum-like feature to add new packages, eg python:
  setup-x86_64.exe -P python
  	it still run the GUI, but then the python package is selected, 
	so can just click next/next/next to complete.
  setup-x86_64.exe -M -P wget,curl,dog,openssh,ctorrent,openldap,nc,rsync
	-M will skip many GUI prompt and go right into the package selection window.
	openssh is for both client and server?
	openldap is for the client portion only

  apt-cyg (not fully stable) may provide an apt-get like command interface to install packages, one at a time.

	wget http://raw.github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg
	chmod +x apt-cyg
	mv apt-cyg /usr/local/bin

	apt-cyg install nano
	apt-cyg install git
	apt-cyg install ca-certificates

<H1>Windows/DOS commands</H1>

<H2>
Key bindings I like
</H2>
Linux adopted most of them, wish the two were even more similar :)

<PRE>
shift win s        = screen clipping, copy to clipboard            [OneNote config?]
shift alt t        = screen clipping, with additional markup tool  [win 10 thing?]

PrtScr             = Print Screen.  But many program now tries to hijack it, so no consistent behavior
                       - Win 10 default: capture whole screen to clipboard ?
                       - OneDrive hijack: save to File in OneDrive ?
</PRE>

<!-- content of cmd.dos.ref -->

<H2>
DOS/CLI commands
</H2>

<PRE>
xcopy d:\ z: /s /e /c /f /z /h	# xcopy from d: to z: , include sub dir, hidden file, etc.


robocopy s:\source\folder1 d:\destination\folder2 /e /move /copyall /tee /log+:robo.log  /w:1 /r:2

	# Robust copy, lot of options, separate tool from MS?
	# /move = move files and dirs  (hopefully not copy and delete if on same FS)
	# /copyall = copy NTFS ACL, owner, and audit info also (these are not included by default)
	# 		but if ACL cannot be copied, copy will fail (reported)
	# /e	= include sub dirs, even if empty
	# /tee /log+:robo.log will do a "T" and append to log file
	# /w:1 /r:2 = wait 1 sec before retry, max 2 retries  
	#  		(good if know waiting won't help unlock file, or will do multi-scan)
	#
	#
	# Note that folder1 itself won't be moved, it is the content inside the folder
	# It is more like folder1\* to folder2.  
	# But folder1 itself will be deleted if /MOVE is used.
	# Don't think too much like Unix!   
	
	# Additional notes:
	# File that cannot be moved (cuz it is locked) 
	# is not reported as error in summary (but as skipped?).
	# But instead of whining and stopping if using the Win Explorer GUI, 
	# Robocopy will continue to move the next file.
	#
	# Files created after Robocopy completes its indexing are not touched.
	#
	# Redirecting output to a log file is good, as it is quite verbose.
	# \\unc\path can be used.
	# 
	# files that already exist in the destination are reported as EXTRA
	# can be /purge if desired.



cacls		= change acl's.  NT cli version of solaris setfacl.
compact		= file compression util (list, maybe set?)




type file | find /i "string"
	# equiv to unix cat file | grep -i string
	# the quotes MUST be used or 
	# find will complain with weired error message!
	# /i = case Insensitive grep.
type file | findstr /i "string"
	# similar to find above, but different binary...

rdisk		= nt4 create emergency recovery disks (erd)

regback		= registry backup (add on?)


title any text string desired
	Set the DOS CLI window to have the desired title


bgjob prog arg
	run bg job inside a telnet session
	so that even if telnet goes away, job remains.
	There is still probably a nohup.

accepted abbreviations (likely in order of decreasing priority):
HKCR    HKEY_Classes_ROOT

HKLM	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKU?    HKEY_USERS

<H2>Windows Startup</H2>
<PRE>
windows program auto load, from registry instead of Startup folder:

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

TLA (likely in order of decreasing priority):
HKCU	HKEY_CURRENT_USER    (take precedence over local_machine if there are duplicates)
HKLM	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

each program has an entry with full path as value, delete individually as needed.
XP has a System Configuration Utility under control panel | help support 
section, so that all current startup places are listed and can be turned off via uncheck.

Many of these can be recognized as normal software, but just always run
at startup, which becomes anoying.

Some spyware may also add hooks here, but if they are really good, 
spyware may replace legit system file and it will need a tool to check 
if it is really spyware or the legit file!

Probably legit programs (could still be replaced by spyware!):

HKLM...Run 	mobsync.exe /logon.  Sync Manager
KHCU...Run	ctfmon.  Office2003 text2speech [potentially key logger]  




Additional crap that is loaded somehow...

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Real\Update_OB\
apperently lot of .dll and .exe which somehow get executed
rnms3270.dll is the realone messanger center crap that do lot of pop up messageging ads.  Delete or rename them!

<H2>Hackish way to reset password</H2>

At least for Win 7.  
Idea is to replace the sethc.exe program, which is what accessibility invokes, and replace it with cmd.exe

issue command
