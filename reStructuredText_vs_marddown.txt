.rst or .md 
===========

For a while, i hated .md cuz use #, ##, ###, to mark as heading.
and I used to like to use those to mark as various comment level.  still do.
but maybe in .md i could learn to use // 

.md now support underline text as rst to indicate heading/titles.
i line them up with earlier text anyway.


so, now in 2020, not necessary hidge sight, 
really finding .rst lack of shortcut for hard new line
and constantly rendering my indented text as weired.

code block/highlight seems to be easier in .md
and most coworker have stuff in .md
so, will start to ponder if .md might be better than .rst for myself after all...

veridic is still pending...

some more reading.
* .md is simpler, but not as feature rich as .reST.  Thus, .md  has many flavors, eg github flavored markdown.
* .rst has lot more feature, can write complex doc, footer, etc, but then the syntax is more complex.
python used reST, Spynx made it popular.

* asciiDoc, .adoc, is pretty old too, but i just learned about it.  
  + simpler syntax, like MD, but still extensible.
  + use = as header rather than #, so solve my #1 gripe about .md
  + may become my new favorite!
  + https://asciidoc.org 
  + .adoc  does not have good support for bullet that span multiple paragraph.  but maybe use sub bullets
