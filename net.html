  interface fa0/37 
  no shutdown

  spanning-tree portfast	# immediate enable port, run spanning tree later.

Implications:
If a switch is plugged into a port that is not pre configured to allow spanning tree, 
it will be blocked, and not even link light will come up.  
'no shutdown' will free up the port for use again.  
spanning-tree fast port, or something like that, enables the spanning tree alg on that port, 
thus allowing the switch to be cascaded.

EMC recommended best practice is one initator and one terminator per zone.  
In practice I found placing both terminator of the Clariion on the same zone to have no adverse effect and make for smaller list of zones.  <BR>
One host for each zone.  Even in a cluster access environment, zoning does not include multiple host.  Storage group configurtaion in Navishere provides LUN access to multiple hosts.

<H3>Cascaded (ISL Linked) Switches</H3>

In a cascaded switch environment, Inter Switch Link (ISL) can be used to 
daisy chain the switches.  Port Trunking can be used, and all VSANs data would be carried on this trunk if it is not explicitly coded to do certain VSAN.
<BR>
One switch would act as the "main" and would usually get all the config.
All zone config should be done on the primary, and when downstream switch come online, they will read such config.
Downstream switch would have some basic info specific to them.  
eg Port VSAN config would be on each switch.
<BR>
One piece that I am still no clear is that, ISL linked switch exchange zone config info.  A <TT>copy running-config startup-config</TT> would write down such config on both switches.  When one issue commands to remove zoning info, it will probably mean doing the <TT>copy run start</TT> on both switches, less the partner has some old info and re-add such info to the runnig-config when it reboots...  <BR>

To be safe, config should be saved on all switches, upstream and downstream.  <BR>
If downstream don't have any zoning config at all, then it is fine and when it reload, it will get the info from the upstream switch.  But in a failure scenario, it seems to work out better if each switch has the config.  It also 
prevent other tool like ESRS making configs that diverges and create DB discrepancy when both swtiches reboot, 
creating a whole SAN zoning mess up.
If the running config is the same on both switch and they reboot, then they will at least provide basic consistency.
<BR>

<BR>
Config should be done on "principle" switch.  But if there are NPIV switch involved, then zoning config should be done
on the CORE NPIV switch, even if it is not the priciple swithc.  Again, save running-config on all switches, check that 
there "show zoneset active" matches up on both switches!!

# copy the active zoneset into a "full-zoneset" db,

# but live running config from active zoneset is correct
 
 
 
# bottom line
# if the active zoneset on the ISL linked switch are the same
# then config is stable
# copy run start (on all switches) from this point would produce consistent result
# (this should dump active zoneset config to config that will be loaded at boot)

<H3>Non-ISL Linked / "Dumb" Access Gateway switch</H3>


If the complexity is not overwhelming and Access Gateway (NPV+NPIV) mode
can be used, this seems to be a much easier config than using ISL.  <BR>
ISL is good for large fabric interconnect that need multiple VSAN traffic, trunk port, etc.  <BR>
Access Gateway mode should be simple and efficient to add ports to connect
more hosts or tape drives than is available from a single switch, 
and just need a simple extension to add more ports.  <BR>
<BR>

Tech jargons: <BR>

NPIV - allows switch to see multiple WWN on the same port w/o configuring ISL.  
<BR>

NPV  - kind of turn switch into "HBA mode", where multiple blades can be viewed as VM on the same server, and NPV mode switch port is viewed like an HBA port that presents multiple WWN to "upstream" switch.  NPV is like emulating server.  <BR>
<BR>





Brocade don't seems to emphasize the diff between NPIV and NPV.  It calls the "dumed" switch in "Access Gateway" mode, so that no programming is done on it.  
It marely pass traffic and WWN to upstream/parent switch (the non-Access Gateway switch), which has all zoning info.  This has benefits of saving Domain ID (limited to 16?), removing inter-vendor interoperability problem (because it does not need ISL config).  The tech allows "merging" multiple physical switch into a single larger virtual switch with many more ports.  
See <A HREF="http://www.brocade.com/downloads/documents/white_papers/Virtualizing_Embedded_Switches_Access_Gateway_WP_01.pdf">Access Gateway whitepaper</A> for more details.
<BR><BR>


<!--
not too useful anymore.
It allows for multiple N_Port (HBA port) to be connected to a single F_port (switch port).
Think of ESX HBA providing multiple N_ports to VM but the switch that it connects is dummy 
(no domain id, no zoning config).
-->


eg In Dell blade chassis switch where multiple 
host is consolidated into a single physical port.  In Access Gateway mode, the 4 WWN will show up, 
but the fc switch act transparently, so avoid the need to have an inter-switch link config, 
which could be quite painful when diff vendors switches are mixed.
With Access Gateway mode, the zoning is all done by the smart switch, and the blade chassis switch is like "dummy" or 
transparent to all the config.
<BR><BR>

Technically, E_Port are used to connect switches together.  F_Ports are the port on the switch that HBA/host node connects to.  N_Port is the port on the HBA card itself.  Access Gateway essentially makes the switch in the blade chassis "disapear" from the logical view of the fabric config, and upstream switch will see N-port WWN connected to it when in fact it is connected to the Access Gateway switch.  E_Port will not show up as ISL is not used.

<BR><BR>
Essentially, the "smart" (upstream) switch is the NPIV switch, and the "dumb" (downstream, access gateway mode) switch is the NPV switch.  <BR>
If want to worry the difference between NPIV (N-port ID Virtualization) vs NPV (N-Port Virtualization), here are a couple of blogs explaining it:

to dig out the online doc, go to section inside IOS 
(they don't have terminal server listed as its own section! A site map may help):

-Cisco Product Documentation
-Cisco IOS Software config
-System Software Release 9.21 (or whatever newest number)
-Then find secions called Communication Server ...
(IOS 8.3 and 9.0 has it listed as Terminal Server)


---

(machine at cc is cisco 2600 series, maybe 2621 (or 2632?)

Connection to machine via terminal server:

telnet axecess
> telnet 2.2.2.2 2036

or, for named connections, just enter telnet db03.
other connection exist, like
connect db03 
rlogin db03


to disconnect from a 'telnet' session to a server, use:

        CTRL-6 x, then type 'disc' at the axecess prompt

to generate a BREAK:

        CTRL-6 b


other telnet escape seq inside the terminal server:
first hit ctrl+shift+6  (ie ctrl+^), 
then enter ? for list of escape seq for the specific telnet session 
with the cisco terminal server.

clearing existing connection (to free up for use again)

axecess> enable
password: 
axecess# clear line 36
[confirm] <CR>

(line 36 was the line of connector 1 line 4, listed as 2036)
(add 2032 to the line cable number that want to connect)

[ from joanne email 
really just 2000+ line number, 
but somehow internally already reserved 32 async lines.  
thus the module we add need 32 + cable number, prepended with 20 in front.
connector 1 would be 2033 to 2040, 
connector 2 would be 2041 to 2048, etc

actually get the image:
	copy  tftp flash SvrIP FILENAME primary

	i guess bootable via alternate cmd.

clear couter	
	reset all counters (collision stats, etc)


upload config tftpSvrIP Filename
	save the configuration to the tftp server at IP with name filename
	Note that tftp server may need to have the file with mode 666 to write.

download config tftpSvrIP Filename
	grab complete config for the switch from a file at the remote tftp svr.
	(never tried)

some brief notes when adding an ip to the switch, and upgrading the os via tftp.

conf default de port 23
create vlan temp
conf temp ipaddr 172.16.17.50 /20
conf temp add port 23
en ipf temp

--
change the netmask of the switch (by specifiying the ip and new netmask bit numbers on the main vlan? 
Or, I suppose for each vlan, the switch has an IP, thus specify that IP and the netmask for it)

conf shared5-1 ipaddress 172.16.0.1/24

shared5-1 is the vlan name shown in show vlan
/24 indicate a class C network, and system automatically convert to use the netmask of 255.255.255.0
note that /20 would convert to netmask of 255.255.240.0

trunking:
	ports that are grouped together to form a trunk is called tagging in ExtremeNet.  
	Thus, a tag on port 1 and 2 would form a 2 GigE trunk

configuring switch from ground up.
this was done by jacinto for ngw1, i copy over, might have missed a few commands.

# This will ERASE EVERYTHING on the config of the switch, and
# reset to factory defaults.
unconfigure switch all


# do not use bootp, which may get ip, config, etc that we don't want
disable bootp default		

config snmp sysName	ngw1-nsw1

# create account for user admin
config account admin			

# ngw1-1 is the primary vlan where all linux modules are in
create vlan ngw1-1
config ngw1-1 ipaddress 172.24.53.1/24
config ngw1-1 add port 1:1-1:32
enable ipf ngw1-1
enable rip 
config rip add vlan ngw1-1

# ??
config rip txmode v1compatible vlan ngw1-1

# this one assign a vlan id to the vlan ngw1-1.
# will need to match on switch for them to actually talk correctly.
config ngw1-1 tag 422

# this is the vip for the load balancer
create vlan ngw1-vip1
config ngw1-vip1 ipaddress 192.168.214.1/24
enable ipf ngw1-vip1
config ngw1-vip1 tag 766
enable rip ngw1

# then are some port config tagging that i did not fully get.
# port 3:1 is the uplink port (separate vlan)
# port 3:2 is the load balancer
# End result is: 
# ngw1-vip1 has 2 ports: untag: 3:1  tag: 3:2
# ngw1-1 has ports 1:1 - 1:32 and tag 3:2

config rip add ngw1-vip1
config ngw1-1 add port 3:2
config ngw1-vip2 add port 3:1

loading new firmware to switch


download image 10.0.1.80 FILENAME primary
# also recommend download to secondary so it can boot in case of disaster

can change use of primary or secondary by: use config ... (?)

show ver

blocking most of the ICMP access list in the cluster
(needed to emulate production config, where gateway in compute modules dying will NOT send ICMP to client to reset NFS moutns).

create access-list permit-icmp-vm1-1 icmp dest 172.24.67.0 /24 source any type 3 code 3 permit ports any precedence 10

create access-list deny-icmp icmp dest any source any type 3 code 3 deny ports any precedence 100

The precedence number is to sort how the switch analyzed these rules.  
lowest number = highest priority = applied first (#1).  
largest, last applied rule is #25600.

The above eg, ICMP from outside to the internam machines are allowed.
The next rule to be analyzed block all otherwise not specified ICMP to be blocked.  
Thus effectively blocking any ICMP originating from the cluster machine to the outside are blocked.  
I have no details of what kind of ICMP commands are in type 3 code 3.

vlan tag stuff, self notes after layoff.

config vlan <vlan_name>
  add ip address
  add tag <tag number>

  add port X tag 
  add port y,z untag


multiple vlan can use the same port as long as the port is added as tag.
the tag will defferentiate the vlan.
the peer router will have the port as multiple vlan also, and will therefore 
be able to route them as necessary.

switch to switch vlan tag, then the port will just behave as if they were separate switch port.  
or think of port needing <port#, tagId> to identify it into a vlan.

in each subnet, only port that need to be shared with other subnet need to be tagged.  
port that goes to computer don't need to be tagged.
note that if tag does not match peer switch/router, then there will be no traffic flowing thru them.

Add the keyword superuser at the end to indicate account can access priviledged sueruser commands.  (like the default admin account)

Listing user:
(config)# no username ?

Note: default admin acc can be erased, but make sure has other user with superuser priviledges!

Showing user info:
(config)# show user-database

Erasing user:

no username <NAME>
