<H1>Package managers for Mac OS/X</H1>

<PRE>

MacPort 	- formerly Darwin port
		  contain lot of "unix style" software packages.
		  install to /opt/local

fink		= package manager like Ubuntu apt-get, oft used by users from Debian world.
		  need to be installed separately, create resource tree independent of mac os x, more unixy...
		  more cutting edge that Mac OS Port.  May have pre-compiled binaries.
		  install to /sw

rudix		= pre-compiled unix sw for OS X (Yosemite in progress, Maverick and older okay)
		  hassle-free.  http://rudix.org/


homebrew	= http://brew.sh/
		  install to /usr/local, which is said why it works!  changing path not recommended!
		  have not been able to get it to install/work behind a proxy :( 
		  Said to depends more on mac os x native packages, more integrated, uses less space.
		  Intended audience = mac users.  
		  [still what I am using in 2023.10]
		  
		  <TT>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</TT>
		  <TT>brew install caskroom/cask/burn added a GUI Burn.app into Applications.</TT>
		  <TT>brew cask</TT> can manage and install mac native apps.  (used by geerlingguy Ansible for DevOps).


nix		= from NixOS, meant to be a declarative (stateless) package management.  
		  package are build from source, but cached to provide performance close to traditional binary-based package manager.

	You should now have a working Fink installation in '/sw'. You still need package descriptions if you want to compile packages yourself. You can get them
	by installing the dists-10.12-0.16.0.tar.gz tarball, or by running either of the commands: 'fink selfupdate-rsync', to update via rsync (generally
	preferred); or 'fink selfupdate-cvs', to update via CVS (more likely to work through a firewall). You should also run 'sudo xcodebuild -license' and
	accept the Xcode license, since some packages will require this.

	Run '. /sw/bin/init.sh' to set up this terminal session environment to use Fink. To make the software installed by Fink available in all of your future
	terminal shells, add '. /sw/bin/init.sh' to the init script '.profile' or '.bash_profile' in your home directory. The program /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh can
	help with this. Enjoy.

<H5>Obsolete method to install Fink</H5>

No longer works?  cuz fink group no longer building .dmg?

<PRE>
installer -pkg Fink*pkg -target LocalSystem
	# similar to rpm -i sw.rpm 
  	# -target LocalSystem is the equiv of the GUI telling where to put the program.  Should be able to use / also.


pkgutil --pkgs 		# list packages installed on system (.pkg, not stuff that Fink install, which are .deb packages).
			# os x command?  but no longer avail in 10.12 ?

dmg are sw image that are &quot;mounted&quot;, accessible from /Volumes.  
Firefox can run off inside such mount.  
Other apps req copying the files there to /Applications folder.  
Yet other require an install from there.

<A NAME="firewall"></A>
<H1>Firewall</H1>

With ~ 10.5, application-based firewall is the default firewall app (controlled by the GUI).  It is a port of OpenBSD PF.
It is good for laptop user who control access to app in allowing remote connection.  But it is not so great for a server-oriented firewall that may want to limit access by IP address range.  In such cases, the old IPFW (derived from FreeBSD) is available from the CLI.  IPFW actually takes precedence over PF; neither of them are on by default.

<H2>Migration/Cloning</H2>


May not be trivial to migrate data from an old mac to a new one... 

<H5>Backup and Prep</H5>

<OL>
<LI> Avoid upgrading OS when planning to migrate soonish down the road.  (Direct machine restore tends to complain OS in destination host is older, not sure if build numbers are different or some bugs).

<LI> Partition a new disk with GUID (Linux parted and mkfs.hfsplus didn't work).  Use the mac disk utility.
<LI> Install an OS on this external disk.  Boot with Cmd-R, select external disk, install the OS on it.
<LI> Run time machine backup to this disk (which is now bootable).
</OL>

<H5>Restore Using Migration Assistant</H5>

<EM>NOT RECOMMENDED</EM>

<OL>
<LI> Start OS, login as normal.
<LI> Run Migratin assistant (under App, Utilities).  migrate data from time machine backup disk.
<LI> The ugly part:
<UL>
	<LI> Migrate only document data matching the user that is logged in and started the Migration assistant.
	<LI> if username doesn't match old computer, then nothing is transfered.
	<LI> Even if username match, didn't copy much.  May need apple id match.
	<LI> But how to create such account?  It is not like MS where you login directly using MS ID.  *sigh* :(
	<LI> It reboot the machine, can't do anything while it migrates
	<LI> 
</UL>
</OL>

<H5>Restore Using Migration Assistant</H5>
<OL>
<LI> Boot machine while holding Cmd-R
<LI> Run Utility of Restore machine from time machine backup
<LI> It will erase the destination computer hd.
<LI> Did feel like it is a clone.  Everything that was left in old computer now login and looks the same in new.
<LI> One Notes and notebook open just fine.  Hope it sync to web directly using a new sync id.
<LI> git repos seems fine
<LI> Did not migrate:  Dropbox.  Google drive
<LI> Apple iCloud need to login, hanging.
<LI> iTunes need new authorization as new computer

<H2>Older mac stuff</H2>

<PRE>

key binding:

cmd key is the apple key
option = alt
ctrl  = control (^)

cmd+tab = similar to windoze alt+tab
boot, option key = boot current os
boot, c = boot from cd
apple + control + power = reboot

---

Enable unix mode boot:
Older Macs:
While booting, enter cmd+opt+O-F
then,
setenv boot-args=-v
shut-down 
This will cause machine to boot like sun machines.


switching between XDarwin X session and Aqua:
ctrl+opt+A
(10.5, they can coexist together)

NIS info from
http://www.bresink.de/osx/nis.html

OS X can act as NIS server.
yp files are in /var/yp
init rc file (?) at
/System/Library/StartupItems/DirectoryServices/DirectoryServices 


OS X NIS client.
Some minimal info in lookupd.
Leopard 10.5 has NIS client build-in.  Just need to specify NIS domain and servers.


NFS mount.  Can specify the mounts in /etc/fstab, linux format.

<H5>Troubleshooting boot up</H5>

<PRE>

Info from Jim.  Appicable to old Mac (PowerPC) 

If the critter won't start up with the C key held down, try the
following (with the CD in the drive)
Hold the Option key on startup, and choose the CD icon and then click
the right-pointing arrow, or
hold control-option-shift-delete on startup.

The former is an Open Firmware method, and the latter is a shortcut to
tell the MacOS Rom to boot form the next available system volume.

If both of these methods fail, restart and hold down option-apple-p-r
for four startup chimes, then try the above methods again. (this resets
pram)

<LI> This may work, since it is actually supported by apple.  
<LI> They require Windows 10 ISO image, use the bootcamp assistant to get drivers.
<LI> Probably can't get it to work with Windows 7, cuz bootcamp assistant on Mac High Sierra will not accept a windows 7 iso, insist on windows 10.

<LI> Windows is closed source.  Apple keep everything as secret.  Don't expect them to leak out to the open source (albeit their servers certainly are running linux!!).  Oh well, no one said this world was perfect right?  hahaha

<H3>PS</H3>
Why I hate Mac OS X ?
<UL>

<LI> How do you switch between windows?!?!  I mean for example switching between 1 specific browser window and 1 terminal window.
I don't want to hit alt-tab and have all browser windows come to the foreground and cover all my terminal windows.  Alt-` to cycle between windows of the same app doesn't help once the paparrazi already covered what I wanted to see from the other app!  I don't think there is a solution to this other than to get a 80" 8k monitor.  Hard to fit that in a messenge bag though, no?


<LI> The file system default to case insenstive.  which resulted in snafu into git repos, since unix case sensitive filenames will result in overwritten files on a mac os x.  spend some good amount of time to figure out what happened, lucky it was with git and able to restore from previous version.  but really, wtf apple?
<LI> Linux terminal, highlight with mouse, paste with middle click.  Or Shift-Insert.  No middle click on any apple mouse/touchpad; or if there were, I have not been able to produce the paste behavior.  The Terminal app allows pasting with PC mouse middle click.  But the clipboard isn't shared with other app (eg chrome).  So it is still often stilll needing the cmd-c and cmd-v.  your hands has just to move between keyboard and mouse so much more often.

<LI> How do you access the File menu with the keyboard?   In Google Docs, Ctrl-Alt-f.  Yeah yeah, on the mac it is called the option key.  I like the derailure and change track logo.  But that reminds me of Alternate path, not option.  So there.  Also, why need so many effing keys when it is just Alt-f on linux?

<LI> Windows borders please.  I have *a lot* of terminals windows open.  

<LI> Finder.  It ain't file explorer/manager.

<LI> Finder.  Why can't you refresh?  No way to trigger a refresh either??!!??!!

<LI> Finder.  Why is Cmd-N open a new tab?  T for tab, no?  Tab and window are two things, they each lead their own life. 

<LI> Finder: Where is the root of my file system?    Go to Folder. Sh-Cmd-G, /.  

<LI> Finder: How do I select a lot, most, but not all files of a directory?  Shift PageDown don't work?  Oh that's right, steve jobs doesn't know what a Page Down key is.  That's just any key, right?

<LI> Finder: where are the pics on the iphone??   Run Image Capture.  
<LI> Image Capture: How do I move pics from the phone to the computer?  Copy and delete.  

<LI> Finder: how many GB are these files taking up ?

<LI> If I am on the mouse (not touchpad), how do i switch workspace?  I got to click on where and where and where and where??  *sigh*

<LI> Where is the Insert key?  Cuz when I run a Linux VM (to get away from MacOS), I could really use that Insert key.  A true Delete key would be quite useful too damn it!

<LI> Still need to send break to some serial port console equipment?  ^a ^b b in screen MAY work for you.  But when I tried it (and really needed it), it didn't work.  Mac just don't like me.  I will not like it back! :-x

Update from High Sierra (2017.11)
<UL>
* There is finally a lock screen option under the apple menu (^Cmd-Q).  (I don't suppose this was added cuz linked an apple watch).
* There is finally a sleep option.  while "closing the lid" is not explicity listed in the power setting, just don't let the computer go to sleep when the screen blanks.  push out the screen saver.  
</UL>

These are cultural, but they have been imprinted into my brain.

<UL>
<LI> Sloppy mouse.  Cuz I am a sloppy guy.
<LI> I want Alt-Tab.  Not Cmd-Tab AND Cmd-` AND Cmd-Lf/Rg.  When I alt-tab between a browser and a terminal, i want ONE window to come to foreground, NOT ALL windows of the app to cover the other window I want to read things from!
</UL>
