<H2>Perl 101</H2>


<BR>

Perl is an interpreted language, but exist tool to turn them into binary.
Perl script can be setuid!!
<BR>
<BR>

The first column is $_[0], next one is $_[1], the whole line is $_ (or @_)
<BR>
Contrast to Awk first column is $1, second is $2, and $0 is the whole input line.
<BR>


<PRE>
reference = pointer.
@array     isn an array, like:  [,,]   ($array[0], $array[1], etc)
\@array    address of array [,,]  (a pointer, stored as 32-bit integer, ie scalar)

@$array    $array is a pointer, take that as address, and there is the array. 
	   Ie decypher \@array
           when declaring ref, use my $array.
           so, that should be what is returned in a fn call.

Finding array size:
my @arr = (2);
print scalar @arr; # first way to print array size
print $#arr; # second way to print array size
my $arrSize = @arr;
print $arrSize; # third way to print array size
</PRE>
<BR>

<H4>Perl Variables</H4>
<PRE>
$scalar = 1;
@array = ( 'a', 'b' );
%hash = ( 'key1' => 'value1',   'key2' => 'value2' );
FILEHANDLE
</PRE>
<BR>
<H4>Objects and Class</H4>
<PRE>
It is essentially a hack on Packages, but bless()ed into a class.
Default Package variables are class-wide variables.  
Instance/method variables need to be inside data structure that has been
bless()ed.  But at time may need to check whether method was called
as class subroutine or as object's method!!
First param for a method call, $_[0], is a ref to the object (or its class), it is done automatically by Perl (using unshift or something).

Be sure to "use strict", or Perl may think of some closure need to applied
to specific variables declared in methods and those may become like 
class-wide data, but in fact "use strict" would mean they should be scoped correctly and destroyed when method is completed.

constructor can be named anything, new() is just the most popular name.
Destructor is called automagically and must be named DESTROY.

<LI>inside perl program: use lib "/path/to/my/lib"

Note that :: is used as directory separator from the "library root dir".  eg
use Bio::Perl::foo;
should find something in $PERL5LIB/Bio/Perl/foo.pm

<H2>One-Liner PERL in shell as AWK replacement</H2>

<PRE>
command line options:
	-e  = inline input for program file
	-n  = do not print/display input line
	-p  = print input line
	-a  = split array automatically (input line into @F field)
	-F: = Use : as field separator (like AWK).  $F[0] is first column , like python.  unlike awk
	-l  = add \n at the end of each array element...  may or may not be what is needed!!


ls -l | perl -nle  'print $_;'				# plain pass thru
ls -l | perl -lne  'if ($_ =~ pattern) {print $_}'	# like grep pattern


ls -l | perl -lane 'print @F'				# split input into @F "field" array
ypcat passwd | perl -F: -lane 'print "$F[0]  $F[2]";'	# print 1st and 3rd column only (ie username and uid) 

ls -l | perl -lane 'if ($F[2] !~ $F[8]) { print $_ };'	# find out dir not owned by the user (eg run in /nfshome)
							# $F[2] is owner column, $F[8] is last column with file/dir name

ls -l | perl -lane 'if ($F[2] !~ $F[8]) { print "chown $F[8] $F[8]"};' &gt; fix.sh  
							# edit fix.sh and run to fix ownership

ls -l | perl -lane 'if ($F[4] == 0 )    { print $_ };'	# list file of size 0
ls -l | perl -lane 'if ($F[4] != 0 )    { print $_ };'	# list file of size not 0




cat /etc/passwd | perl -F: -lane 'print "$F[6] $F[0]"'

cat /etc/passwd | perl -F: -nle 'chomp; @F = split( /:/, $_ ); print "$F[6] $F[0]";'
	
# above 2 lines should be equivalent, 
# but sometime newline is attached to last column and automatic
# array split can't chop it off, and so need
# to do it manually



echo "az" | perl -nle 'print ++$_'			# increment an alpha string, eg return "ba" 


perl -e 'use Bio::Perl;'				# test whether a given package is installed
perl -e 'use DBI;'


perl -spi 's/ftp/FTP-disabled/'  /etc/passwd 		# inline substitution in a file, no (manual) tmp file creation needed.
							# same as: sed -i 's/ftp/FTP-disabled/' /etc/passwd


# print the directory stack  one line at a time with a number prefix usable with pushd +N
# have not figure out a way to put this as an alias, thus, place in script called Dirs

<H2>POD/Perldoc</H2>

Plain Old Doc can be embeded inside perl code itself, and perldoc perl.html (this file)
will produce man page like documentation.
pod commands start with = , and most often, need to have blank line before 
and after it!
<BR>

eg:

<PRE class="code">

=head1  Description

Plain text can now go in here, and it will be wrapped.
New line isn't really  headed, and formatter will
join them and wrap at end of screen line.

=cut

=pod

  = pod doesn't do much, other than it is text to be placed in pod doc.
  when space/tab is prefixed in
  the begining of the line
  then perldoc will treat it like quoted text
  and format them verbatim


  lastly, for html OL item list stuff, need to have a block delimited as
  = over
  = back
  and add entries with 
  = item  itemName

=cut


=over

=item  ItemName

what ever describe an item, these will be indented

=item *

instead of name, * should produce bullet, but seems to be formated as ?  :(
in real life, don't mix name with bullet was a best practice...

open( FH-OUT, "> /path/to/outputfile" );
while( <FH-IN> ) { print (FH-OUT $_); }
close( FH-IN );

Note that it seems that while the file handle is open, a self-recursive call 
will mangle up the FH internal db, thereby closing it when inner code returns.  
One solution is read file into memory bugger and close FH before making recursive call.


calling main will all input args:
main($#ARGV+1, @ARGV);

package Bestiary;		# store this in file Bestiary.pm

require Exporter; 		# copy these two lines verbatim 
our @ISA = ("Exporter");	# work as inheritance from exporter class.

# then, have these:
our @EXPORT    = qw($camel %wolf ram);              # Export by default
our @EXPORT_OK = qw(leopard @llama $emu);           # Export by request
our %EXPORT_TAGS = (                                # Export as group

                     critters => [qw(ram $camel %wolf)],
                   );


# so, in a program that "use Bestiary", 
# by default, it can access ram instead of having to do Restiary::ram

# The export as group need to be imported as "use Bestiary qw( :camelids )"
# colon is needed for tags, not for the export by request list.

# for variables declared in the module w/o my, they can be accessed as
# $Bestiary::emu  (funny symbol before package name).


#  running cmd in shell.

# Manish said that system use lot of buffering, and can something get confused and stuck if the are closed output... use $! = 1 to get around the problem.




###### styles ########

for sizable script, use a file to define all the commands, scripts, etc that will be called, eg defineCmd.pm.
This way, the defineCmd.pm can be smart enough to detect platform changes of where commands are, or the need to move script to different dir.  

if( os == rh )
ping = ...
ifconfig = ...
elsif( os = sunos )
pint = ...
ifconfig = ...


if sys admin, think about setting a dir where all executable are located, independent of platform, but this will result to non-portable code.

Download CPAN modules and install automatically as root to local system:
Note that which perl is invoked is important.
sun stock perl used cc for compile, prefer to use sunfreeware.com that install to /usr/local, and use gcc.
Also, remember that module names are case sensitive.


If there are more than one compiler, 
def env var may help:
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc		(does it really use a CC compiler??)
MAKE= ...  (is it $MAKE?)
Best to config CPAN as root and define the setting of where all the programs are located.

perl -MCPAN -e shell			# abreviated as cpan in perl5
o conf prerequisites_policy 		# learn about the config
o conf prerequisites_policy follow	# set to automatically get dependencies (def?)
o conf prerequisites_policy ask		# change to prompt before adding prereq
install Mail::SpamAssasin                (spell?)
install Digest::Nilsima
install URI::Escape
quit

or in non-interactive mode:
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Chocolate::Belgian'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::DNS'

Files are stored in a variety of places :(
@INC is probably set differently, and multiple version can exist :(

/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0...

find /usr/local/lib/perl5/ -name '*SHA1*'

<H4>Troubleshooting CPAN install</H4>

<H5>Uninstalling/Reinstalling a module</H5>

There is no easy way to uninstall a module.  CPAN is not a package manager :(
But most package have a .package list.  It list all the files and the path they were installed.
Can use this to remove the files.
After this step, cpan can be run and installing the module should start from scratch again.
(cpan should not complain that the module is already installed, given it find the files are not there.  partial file delete should work, but if trying to make backup, be careful to copy/move all files).
<BR>
eg.  cpan install of DBD::Pg left package list at 
/usr/prog/perl/5.16.3_gcc/lib/site_perl/5.16.3/x86_64-linux/auto/DBD/Pg/.packlist


<H5>Manual install of modules</H5>

<PRE>

If a CPAN module won't install, go to the shell and 
cd to the dir where the build location is, and try to run "make" manually, eg

cd /home/tin/.cpan/build/Inline-Java-0.53-Fyk_8W
perl Makefile.PL

<H2>Perl Debugger</H2>

<!--perl.dbg.ref-->
<PRE class="quote">




perl debugger.

invoked by calling perl with -d option:
perl -d <program-to-debug>


perl debugger is really just perl running with addional support (from DB module to store state info).  
It is not totally seprated from the program as traditional debugger.

To execute any perl code w/in a debugging program, just enter the perl code.  
Anything that is not understood by debugger is considered perl code and executed via eval, 
in the context at the debugging point of the program.

Debugger uses csh-like cmd edit.  
! num, ! cmd, etc to excute cmd, H for history

debugger cmd (commoner stuff):

t				: toggle trace mode (on emulate sh -x, print all code as executed)
R				: reload/restart the debugger

b fn-name			: set breakpoint at fn
b LINE				: set breakpoint at line num (breakable lines has colon after num)
b sub-name			: set breakpoint at a subroutine name
b load FILE			: set breakpint when FILE is first loaded (by use, require?)
d LINE				: remove breakpoint at line
D				: remove all breakpoint
L				: list all breakpoint

c				: continue 
s				: step (will enter into subroutine)
n				: next (execute subroutine completely and return, ie "step over")
<ENTER>				: previous n or s cmd is repeated
r				: return from current running subroutine

T				: backTrace of fn call seq
S pattern			: list all subroutines (with optional pattern for name)
w lineNum			: look at "window" of source code around break point (or around lineNum)
w w				: display more lines than single w by itself.
-				: print previous few lines
l LINE|SUB			: display Lines of code around LINE, SUB, (etc).
/PATTERN			: search fwd in prog for PATTERN (think of vi search)

p $varname			: print value of $varname.
f				: something about switching file (to be read, set breakpoint?)
o				: set lot of option stuff about the dbg


h				: help.  Use h h for concise usage.
h CMD				: help on the given command.
H				: cmd line History

use pipe preceding cmd will run cmd thru the pager.  eg |h to page thru help


Inlined debugger command inside perl programs.  If debugger isn't running, these command will be harmless.

$DB::single = 1		: s = stop program, return command to debugger.
$DB::single = 2		: n
$DB::trace  = 1		: t = trace on ?
