Primary source for OFED.  Somewhat convoluted, thus a bit of work to get them compiled on your platform.
 Compilation for MPI, MVAPICH, etc would be needed for HPC env. 
 They include ULP (upper layer protocol) such as IPoIB.  <BR>

<LI>RHEL ofed      - RHEL backport fixes, and keep a more usable OFED stack than the community version.  use this before using community version to avoid headache (eg luster compatibility).   <BR>
<LI>mellanox.com   - compile binaries for major distro, used to be about 3 months lag behind source, but probably best route for supported cards.  <BR>
If updateing OS, need to get new version of driver, and recompile for the OS.  may take some 15 min to compile and install.
May also disable opensmd systemd , just need to re-enable it

CA  - Control Adaptor  <BR>
HCA - Host CA  (like how FibreChannel has HBA)  <BR>
LID - Local ID, uniq id of IB end points.  <BR>
port - a port on the HCA, like NIC ports in ethernet quad card.  <BR>

GUID - Global Uniq ID <BR>
	sminfo give the GUID of the subnet manager, can be used to determine if two nodes are on same fabric or in two separate islands.  <BR>
<BR>

Symbol Error - Think of this as packet error in the ethernet world.  it is the rate of error accumulation that should be of concern. <BR>
<BR>

XmtDiscards - counter indicative of congestion (concern when rate of increase is rapid)
<BR>

<BR>

Verbs - IB allow code to be run on the network.  Think optimizing calls for calculating sum of counters distributed among many IB hosts.  Verbs allow command to be executed on feature-rich IB swtich.  
<BR>

<PRE>
opensm 	# open fabric subnet manager.  run on one of the host.  
	# additional standy manager on other hosts can be setup.  
	# the daemon process will only bind to ONE IB port.  
	# HA fabrics should be joined into a single one.
  	# Fix opensm.conf to bind to desired guid (port).   
	# not specifiying one will get prompt to choose if multiple port is avail.
	# If have two-port card and need TWO subnet manager, then need to 
	# update /etc/init.d/opensm and start TWO instance of opensmd
	# use -g GUID to specify which port each instance use.  this would overwrite config in /etc/opensm/opensm.conf. eg 
 	# /usr/sbin/opensm --daemon 
 	# /usr/sbin/opensm --daemon -g 0x506b4b03007c00c2

OFED has ib driver and opensm
Mellanox compiled their own version and provide support for it, MLNX_OFED, aka MOFED.  has driver and opensm.  No more support for ConnectX-2 cards in 2018.
SL7 version of OFED is said to have less trouble with LUSTER than general public OFED.


opensm --create-config /tmp/opensm.conf 
cp -i /tmp/opensm.conf /etc/opensm/
vi /etc/opensm/opensm.conf # set GUID for the port where openSM should bind to

ibstat
  - all ports should be active.  It would be active if there is running fabric manager to register them when the port comes alive.
  - If port is connected, but no running Subnet Manager, port status would be Initiating
  - If port status is Down, then there is problem with physical link (even when no SM is running)  Reseating after SM is running may help.
  - node guid
  - port guid

<H2>IBoIP with Bonding Config</H2>


OFED 1.4 instructions for configuring bonding for IPoIB interfaces is to create static config in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts for the file ifcfg-bond0, ifcfg-ib0, ifcfg-ib1, as below:

<H5>IB-bond for system WITHOUT ethernet bond</H5>
<PRE class="code">
$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0
DEVICE=bond0
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=10.2.2.98
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
NETWORK=10.2.2.0
BROADCAST=10.2.2.255
ONBOOT=yes
USERCTL=no
TYPE=Bonding

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ib0  
DEVICE=ib0
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
USERCTL=no
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
TYPE=InfiniBand

$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ib1
DEVICE=ib1
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
USERCTL=no
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
TYPE=InfiniBand

# relevant entries in  /etc/modprobe.conf ::
## added for Oracle 10/11 (per Cambridge WI)
## make sure that the hangcheck-timer kernel module is set to load when the system boots
options hangcheck-timer hangcheck_tick=1 hangcheck_margin=10 hangcheck_reboot=1
alias ib0 ib_ipoib
alias ib1 ib_ipoib
alias net-pf-27 ib_sdp
##  For IB bonding
alias bond0 bonding
options bond0 miimon=100 mode=1 max_bonds=1

</PRE>

As of OFED 1.4.0 (circa 2009.09), the above bonding config would work, bond0 would be created correctly and disabling the ib port for say ib0 would cause thigns to fail over.  <BR><BR>

However, fail over won't actually work if the machine also has ethernet bonding configured.
The config would successfully create a bond for ib0 and ib1.  
But the IP would be bond to 
a specific interface and when the IB port is disabled from the switch, ping and rds-ping would stop working. 
Maybe it has to do with some bugs in the ifcfg-* scripts in RHEL 5.3 that associate the HW "mac address"
of the ibX interfaces incorrectly to the bonding interface. 
OFED 1.4.x doesn't support the bonding config in /etc/inifiniband/openib.conf anymore.
Manually creating the ib-bond after system boot would work, and fail over actually works correctly.
Here is the required config:

There is one final catch.  eth fail over work for one NIC at a time.
If both eth0 and eth1 is ifdown'd, the minute eth0 is ifup, the machine reset.
Not sure why, no log message, so may not even be a kernel panic...
But if both eth interfaces are down, machine is probably screwed anyway...

<H2>RDS and InfiniBand</H2>

RDS stands for Reliable Datagram Socket.  
It was modeled/designed like a UDP replacement, but adds reliability and 
in-sequence delivery characteristics traditionally only available from TCP.
It was to be lightweight, rely on the InfiniBand hardware to do the 
path mapping and "virtual channel" config.
<BR>
<BR>
The RDS developer mailing list has a <A HREF="http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/rds-devel/2007-November/000228.html">doc</A>
that indicates RDS would not depend on IP when run on InfiniBand, so then IBoIP may not actually need to be configured  (eg, how MPICH work with infiniband without any IP support).  

On the flip side, there are also discussion of implementing RDS over TCP! (eg:
<A HREF="http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/rds-devel/2009-February/000966.html">take 2</A>) 
At any rate, rds-ping needs an IP address.   rds-info is centered around the premise of IP address.  
Oracle doesn't work unless IP are assigned for IB interface.
<BR>
<BR>
So, for HA (at least for Oracle), it seems that IBoIP fail over from the IB-bonding need to be configured.
Oracle cluster/RAC does not have ability to use multiple ib0, ib1 interfaces
as its private network, so some sort of automatic HCA fail over would be needed.
<BR>
<BR>

<H2>RDMA and InfiniBand</H2>

RDMA = Remote DMA , ie Remote Direct Memory Access. <BR>

It would allow data transfer between two hosts with IB HCA to copy data from one host directly into the other, bypassing the many copy needed of traditional NIC.  Combined with low latency of IB, it would give very high transfer speed.
<BR>
However, RDMA is not implemented by RDS as of OFED 1.4.
(it is for TCP? but that would be at the IPoIB layer?  Or maybe
for things that use IB directly like MPICH...  don't know....).

mst in turn req OFED driver installed.
(have not found way to run these out of docker container, even when Mellanox seems to have something for this, maybe for some product they have which i have not found doc about yet).

also need a Mellanox MAM1Q00A-QSA for each port you want to be on ethernet as well as SR optics.

Change to Ethernet mode for dual port card:

eg# mlxconfig -d /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2 LINK_TYPE_P2=2

mlxconfig --dev /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2

Device #1:
----------

Device type:    ConnectX5       
Name:           N/A             
Description:    N/A             
Device:         /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0

Configurations:                              Next Boot       New
         LINK_TYPE_P1                        IB(1)           ETH(2)          


reboot needed for change to be effected.

VPI mode automagically do Eth and IB, no need to change its mode?
Some card can only do IB or only Eth, can't be changed?

**no, likely need to still flip to eth so that os assign a ifconfig nic name to it. **

enp1s0f? are likely the onboard RJ45 ports.
