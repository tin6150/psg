Primary source for OFED.  Somewhat convoluted, thus a bit of work to get them compiled on your platform.
 Compilation for MPI, MVAPICH, etc would be needed for HPC env. 
 They include ULP (upper layer protocol) such as IPoIB.  <BR>

<LI>RHEL ofed      - RHEL backport fixes, and keep a more usable OFED stack than the community version.  use this before using community version to avoid headache (eg luster compatibility).   <BR>
<LI>mellanox.com   - compile binaries for major distro, used to be about 3 months lag behind source, but probably best route for supported cards.  <BR>
If updateing OS, need to get new version of driver, and recompile for the OS.  may take some 15 min to compile and install.
May also disable opensmd systemd , just need to re-enable it


<LI>
	It seems that the current trend is to use the ofed drivers.

<H2>InfiniBand 101 </H2>

CA  - Control Adaptor  <BR>
HCA - Host CA  (like how FibreChannel has HBA)  <BR>
LID - Local ID, uniq id of IB end points.  <BR>
port - a port on the HCA, like NIC ports in ethernet quad card.  <BR>

GUID - Global Uniq ID <BR>
	sminfo give the GUID of the subnet manager, can be used to determine if two nodes are on same fabric or in two separate islands.  <BR>
<BR>

Symbol Error - Think of this as packet error in the ethernet world.  it is the rate of error accumulation that should be of concern. <BR>
<BR>

XmtDiscards - counter indicative of congestion (concern when rate of increase is rapid)
<BR>

<BR>

Verbs - IB allow code to be run on the network.  Think optimizing calls for calculating sum of counters distributed among many IB hosts.  Verbs allow command to be executed on feature-rich IB swtich.  
<BR>

PS.  Mellanox ConnectX-5, 6  can take AI-branded QSFP modules (but not the other way around).

<H2>InfiniBand Generations </H2>

Modulation


<PRE>

SDR - Single Data Rate              4x2.5 = 10 Gbps  (8 Gbps accounting for bit encoding overhead)
DDR - Double Data Rate              4x 5  = 20 Gbps
QDR - Quad Data Rate.       QSFP,   4x10 =  40 Gbps.  CX-2 ??
FDR - Fith? Data Rate.      QSFP,   4x14 =  56 Gbps.  CX-3
EDR - Enhanced Data Rate.   QSFP28, 4x25 = 100 Gbps.  CX-4 ?  CX-5?  NRZ modulation.    Backward compatible with FDR.
HDR - High?/Hyper? DR.      QSFP56, 4x50 = 200 Gbps.  CX-6 can do HDR200 or Y-split 2x HDR100.  PAM4 modulation.  2018.  Backward compatible at 10/25/40/50/100/200G, but matching cables would be needed.
NDR -  QSFP-DD?  8x50?
XDR -  OSFP ?    8x50? 

modulation (think encoding):
NRZ:   Non-Return-to-Zero: traditional binary, on/off 1 bit per cycle.  Is this same as PAM-2? 
PAM-4: Pulse Amplitude Modulation-4: 2 bits per PAM4 symbol, encoded via 4 mean voltages: VA, VB,VC, VD.

Arista 7280R2 - 25 Gbps SERDES?  QSFP28 ports, Max out at 100Gbps?  only do NRZ?
Arista 7280R3 - 50 Gbps SERDES?  QSFP56 ports, Capable of 200Gbps?  Capable of PAM4 ?

ConnectX-6 can connect to slower equipment, but note that HDR cable will negotiage PAM4.  EDR cable would be needed to have it negotiate to NRZ.
In practice, used ConnectX-6 HBA, HDR100 cable, connected to EDR switch, and it worked.  ibstat reports Rate: 100, so presumably did negotiate NRZ cuz of the EDR switch and use 4x25.
Still don't understand why HDR cables have IB version vs Ethernet version (they are not interchangeable).

</PRE>


<H2>Generation cross compatibility</H2>

The following note is from wonderful colleage Chris from Mellanox/Nvidia:
<BR><BR>

Each product (Adapters/Eth Switches/IB switches) has its own firmware compatibility lists.
The firmware notes for each product will have compatibility cross maps.
<BR><BR>

FDR Adapters and Switches using FDR cables are compatible with QDR/FDR/FDR10/EDR/HDR*  (*HDR firmware has notes about specific ports)
<BR><BR>

EDR Adapters and Switches  using EDR cables  are compatible with EDR/HDR/FDR**  (** FDR does not officially support EDR cables due to the higher wattage and may not work in some cases)  
<BR>
[If a HDR cable is used in EDR environment, the HDR cable will try to negotiate PAM4, which EDR does NOT understand (it only supports NRZ modulelation)].  
<BR><BR>

HDR Adapters and Switches using HDR cables  are compatible with HDR only.  HDR â€“ PAM4 encoding and will assume PAM4 when an HDR cable is used (EEPROM is read).
<BR><BR>

ConnextX-6 dual port adapters will support 1/10/40/25/50/100/200 FDR/EDR/HDR when the correct cables/port adapter is used, <EM>AND ONLY 1 port is used</EM>.
<BR><BR>

If both ports are enabled on the dual port card, some internal clocks will be limited to 25/50/100/200 EDR/HDR only   
<BR><BR>


<EM>
The basic rule I tell customers is to always use the cable that is compatible with the lowest speed of the 2 devices. The higher speed cables require higher power at the port, and also have an EEPROM letting the port know what speed to start the negotiation.  
</EM>
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
 

Ethernet it gets very complicated, you will need to know if the Adapter or switch is PAM4, and make sure you are using the compatible cables. Mellanox/NVIDIA equipment will also use the EEPROM in the cables to establish the correct negotiation (PAM4 or NRZ). I would also reference the firmware notes of each product to determine cross compatibilities. When using 3rd party equipment it is not a guarantee they are backwards/forwards compatible.

opensm 	# open fabric subnet manager.  run on one of the host.  
	# additional standy manager on other hosts can be setup.  
	# the daemon process will only bind to ONE IB port.  
	# HA fabrics should be joined into a single one.
  	# Fix opensm.conf to bind to desired guid (port).   
	# not specifiying one will get prompt to choose if multiple port is avail.
	# If have two-port card and need TWO subnet manager, then need to

OFED has ib driver and opensm
Mellanox compiled their own version and provide support for it, MLNX_OFED, aka MOFED.  has driver and opensm.  No more support for ConnectX-2 cards in 2018.
SL7 version of OFED is said to have less trouble with LUSTER than general public OFED.

<H5>Troubleshooting commands</H5>

ibstat
  - all ports should be active.  It would be active if there is running fabric manager to register them when the port comes alive.
  - If port is connected, but no running Subnet Manager, port status would be Initiating
  - If port status is Down, then there is problem with physical link (even when no SM is running)  Reseating after SM is running may help.
  - node guid
  - port guid

<H2>IBoIP with Bonding Config</H2>


OFED 1.4 instructions for configuring bonding for IPoIB interfaces is to create static config in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts for the file ifcfg-bond0, ifcfg-ib0, ifcfg-ib1, as below:

<H5>IB-bond for system WITHOUT ethernet bond</H5>
<PRE class="code">
$ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0

# relevant entries in  /etc/modprobe.conf ::

alias ib0 ib_ipoib

##  For IB bonding
alias bond0 bonding
options bond0 miimon=100 mode=1 max_bonds=1

</PRE>

As of OFED 1.4.0 (circa 2009.09), the above bonding config would work, bond0 would be created correctly and disabling the ib port for say ib0 would cause thigns to fail over.  <BR><BR>

However, fail over won't actually work if the machine also has ethernet bonding configured.
The config would successfully create a bond for ib0 and ib1.  
But the IP would be bond to 
a specific interface and when the IB port is disabled from the switch, ping and rds-ping would stop working. 
Maybe it has to do with some bugs in the ifcfg-* scripts in RHEL 5.3 that associate the HW "mac address"
of the ibX interfaces incorrectly to the bonding interface. 
OFED 1.4.x doesn't support the bonding config in /etc/inifiniband/openib.conf anymore.
Manually creating the ib-bond after system boot would work, and fail over actually works correctly.
Here is the required config:

There is one final catch.  eth fail over work for one NIC at a time.
If both eth0 and eth1 is ifdown'd, the minute eth0 is ifup, the machine reset.
Not sure why, no log message, so may not even be a kernel panic...
But if both eth interfaces are down, machine is probably screwed anyway...

<H2>RDS and InfiniBand</H2>

RDS stands for Reliable Datagram Socket.  
It was modeled/designed like a UDP replacement, but adds reliability and 
in-sequence delivery characteristics traditionally only available from TCP.
It was to be lightweight, rely on the InfiniBand hardware to do the 
path mapping and "virtual channel" config.
<BR>
<BR>
The RDS developer mailing list has a <A HREF="http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/rds-devel/2007-November/000228.html">doc</A>
that indicates RDS would not depend on IP when run on InfiniBand, so then IBoIP may not actually need to be configured  (eg, how MPICH work with infiniband without any IP support).  

On the flip side, there are also discussion of implementing RDS over TCP! (eg:
<A HREF="http://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/rds-devel/2009-February/000966.html">take 2</A>) 
At any rate, rds-ping needs an IP address.   rds-info is centered around the premise of IP address.  
Oracle doesn't work unless IP are assigned for IB interface.
<BR>
<BR>
So, for HA (at least for Oracle), it seems that IBoIP fail over from the IB-bonding need to be configured.
Oracle cluster/RAC does not have ability to use multiple ib0, ib1 interfaces
as its private network, so some sort of automatic HCA fail over would be needed.
<BR>
<BR>

<H2>RDMA and InfiniBand</H2>

RDMA = Remote DMA , ie Remote Direct Memory Access. <BR>

It would allow data transfer between two hosts with IB HCA to copy data from one host directly into the other, bypassing the many copy needed of traditional NIC.  Combined with low latency of IB, it would give very high transfer speed.
<BR>
However, RDMA is not implemented by RDS as of OFED 1.4.
(it is for TCP? but that would be at the IPoIB layer?  Or maybe
for things that use IB directly like MPICH...  don't know....).
<BR>

the C0002 version is an ethernet cable, in IB it will negotiate to 10Gb in FDR config, and not work at all for EDR config.  
the E002E30 version is IB and can negotiate down to 56Gb and run at FDR rate!
part matter!!

HDR100 vs 100GbE cables (Y-split version):
both cables have the same Model number:  MCP7H50

MCP7H50-V002R26 - 100GbE
MCP7H50-H002R26 - HDR100  (presumably works in IB mode "only")
(The 100GbE marking was on the cable connector, use of cable negotiated to 5 Gbps when used as IB.  ibnetdiscover reported it as SDR).

<H5>change IB card to Eth mode </H5>




<PRE>

mlxconfig --dev /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2                  # single port NIC
mlxconfig --dev /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2 LINK_TYPE_P2=2   # dual   port NIC


for Mellanox ConnectX-4 

may need to run 
mst start
mst status
to create /dev/mst device 
allegedly once in eth mode, no need for any of these things.
mst in turn req OFED driver installed.
(have not found way to run these out of docker container, even when Mellanox seems to have something for this, maybe for some product they have which i have not found doc about yet).

also need a Mellanox MAM1Q00A-QSA for each port you want to be on ethernet as well as SR optics.  



https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/getting-started-with-connectx-5-100gb-s-adapters-for-linux



Note that the LINK_TYPE_P1 and LINK_TYPE_P2 equal 1 (InfiniBand) by default.

 mlxconfig -d /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 query
 (or simply mlxdonfig query)
 --dev name depends on what "mst status" reports

eg2 (connectX-3 MT27500):
mlxconfig --dev /dev/mst/mt4099_pciconf0 query | grep LINK_TY
         LINK_TYPE_P1                        VPI(3)          
		 LINK_TYPE_P2                        VPI(3)          

eg3 (ConnectX-5 MT27800):
         LINK_TYPE_P1                        IB(1)           


before eth mode on CX-5 card, ifconfig reports:

Change to Ethernet mode for dual port card:

eg# mlxconfig -d /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2 LINK_TYPE_P2=2

mlxconfig --dev /dev/mst/mt4119_pciconf0 set LINK_TYPE_P1=2

reboot needed for change to be effected.

VPI mode automagically do Eth and IB, no need to change its mode?
Some card can only do IB or only Eth, can't be changed?

**no, likely need to still flip to eth so that os assign a ifconfig nic name to it. **
