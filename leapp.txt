using it to test leapp, upgrade util from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8, for use on beppic2_rhel7.
seems to work for CentOS 7, likely upgrade to CentOS 8, which is now upstream of RHEL 8, but should be close enough to test this leapp util.

even CentOS 7 to Rocky 8!

will add MATE to it first.
sudo yum groupinstall "MATE Desktop"


sudo yum install -y yum-plugin-copr                    # copr = collection of personal repository
sudo yum copr enable -y @leapp/leapp-devel
# above step need to have RH CDN access eg have subscription or satellite or rhui etc
# subscription-manager enable # fails with rh username, did some other stuff, stuck again.  gave up.

sudo yum install -y leapp

## try from a rhel 7 system
